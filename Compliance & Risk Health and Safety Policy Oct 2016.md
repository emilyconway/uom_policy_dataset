# STATEMENT OF HEALTH & SAFETY POLICY

# Compliance & Risk, General Counsel and Office of the Registrar, Secretary and Chief Operating Officer 2015/16

# Part 1: Statement of general policy

1. It is my policy to set high standards and progressive improvement in the health, safety and welfare of my staff together with those of the Registrar, Secretary and Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel and all others who may be affected by our work activities. Compliance and Risk will do all that is reasonably practicable to implement best practice in the management of health and safety, and to set an example to those receiving advice from its staff. In particular, I recognise that health and safety is a core management function and best practice entails its full integration into the management of all other activities. I will endeavour to ensure that adequate resources are provided to support this policy.

2. I recognise and support the University’s own health and safety management intentions, as expressed in its policy statement. As far as is reasonably practicable and to the extent that I have control or influence, I am committed to:

- working towards good and best practice by a process of continual improvement and compliance with all relevant legislation, codes of practice, and other appropriate guidance;
- encouraging managers to show leadership and commitment in managing health and safety
- managing health and safety through the processes of risk assessment and risk control, implemented by managers;
- providing and maintaining premises and equipment, plant and equipment, and systems of work that are, so far as is reasonably practicable, without risks to health and safety;
- providing appropriate information, instruction, training and supervision to all those involved in risk assessment and control, and in particular, to ensure that staff receive such training as is required for them to be able to discharge their tasks and duties in a competent and safe manner;
- integrating the assessment of health & safety training needs into the process of personal development review;
- maintaining the workplaces under my control, and the means of access and egress, in a safe condition;
- providing and maintaining a safe and healthy working environment;

# Part 2: Organisation

The Director of Compliance & Risk has delegated day-to-day management of health and safety to the Heads of Radiological Safety, Safety Services and Deputy Secretary. See organisation chart in Appendix 1.

The University Safety Co-ordinator for PSS has also been appointed to act as health and safety administrator for C&R and the offices of the Registrar Secretary and Chief Operating Officer, the Director of Social Responsibility and the General Counsel {the three associated offices (AOs)}. The safety administrator has the responsibilities listed in the University’s Health & Safety Policy Statement, which have been adapted for C&R and the three AOs and are reproduced in Appendix 2.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Director of C&R retains responsibility for the Health and Safety of direct reports (C&R Officer, Risk Manager and Information Security Manager). The Director of C&R has no line management responsibility for the Health and Safety of staff within the three AOs.

# Communications

Health & safety information is provided at team briefings, core briefs and safety circulars. All staff are encouraged to communicate informally with their line managers regarding any concerns or questions on their personal health, wellbeing and safety, either on a one-to-one basis, or at regular team meetings. These managers are expected to respond, or if they cannot respond satisfactorily, to bring the matter to my attention.

Every member of staff within C&R, General Counsel and Office of the Registrar, Secretary and Chief Operating Officer will receive a copy of this statement, and any revision or update of it.

I communicate regularly with each C&R manager, and health & safety issues may arise at any informal occasion.

# Health & safety training

Assessment of health & safety training needs are fully incorporated into personal development reviews in a regular and structured manner, and ad hoc needs addressed by the team managers.

# Monitoring and Review

In consultation with the Director of C&R the safety administrator will convene a health & safety networking group meeting, at least once a year, in order to review formally health and safety matters across C&R and the three AOs. A review of arrangements will include but not limited to, an assessment of the annual monitoring report, a summary of accidents, incidents or complaints during the year and any recommendations arising from their investigation, and any other relevant matters. The outcome from this process will be reported to the staff via the existing team briefing arrangements.
