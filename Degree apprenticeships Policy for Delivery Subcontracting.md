# 1. Introduction

1.1 In order to adhere to the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) rules, this policy sets out the requirement for subcontracting provision for degree and higher apprenticeships delivered across the University.

# 2. Scope

2.1 This policy applies to all apprenticeship subcontractor partner provision secured by the University including, where necessary, the delivery of Functional Skills English and Maths level 2 qualifications as part of the apprenticeship programme.

# 3. Procurement and Contracting

3.1 The University will at all times undertake fair and transparent procurement activities and will undertake a robust process of due diligence when selecting potential subcontractors to ensure the highest quality of learning delivery is made available which demonstrates value for money and has a positive impact on the experience of both Employers and Learners.
